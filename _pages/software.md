Below is a curated list of software packages, machine-learning pipelines, and analysis tools that I have developed or supervised. These tools support research in helioseismology, solar imaging, space-weather forecasting, and automated feature detection.

## **1) FASTARR — FArSide Trained Active Region Recognition**
**Type:** Python (Deep Learning)  
**Description:**  
A U-Net–based machine learning pipeline for detecting far-side solar active regions using helioseismic phase-shift maps. The model is trained on AR masks derived from far-side EUV observations and Earth-side magnetograms, providing robust scientific feature identification for heliophysics and space-weather applications.

## **2) Automated Coronal Hole Identification Algorithm**
**Type:** MATLAB  
**Description:**  
Code for automated identification and mapping of coronal holes (CHs) from EUV synoptic maps. The workflow uses segmentation, thresholding, and statistical refinements to produce high-quality CH boundaries suitable for synoptic charts, space-weather modeling, and machine-learning pipelines.

## **3) Far-Side Active Region Identification Algorithm**
**Type:** MATLAB  
**Description:**  
Automated active region identification code for far-side helioseismic and EUV-based maps. Uses intensity, morphology, and statistical thresholds to produce AR masks for far-side magnetic reconstructions and validation of helioseismic signatures.

## **4) Deep Learning Model for High-Speed Solar Wind Stream Prediction**
**Authors:** Abraham-Alowonle, Joseph-Judah (Rights Holder), Hamada, Amr (Supervisor), *et al.*  
**Type:** Python (Deep Learning)  
**Description:**  
A deep learning framework to predict high-speed solar wind streams based on spatio-temporal CH evolution. Includes preprocessing, model training scripts, and evaluation tools for forecasting studies.
